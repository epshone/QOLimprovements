# QOLimprovements
## Appian Tabs
Appian Tabs Alpha version 0.2 is a state of the art QOL improvement which takes an action that used to take seconds and makes it take less seconds. 

Blaze past the competition with newly exposed keyboard shortcuts which open new tabs for common Appian URLS (/design, /designer, /design/rule, /tempo, /admin, /database).

Appian Tabs will automatically detect your current environment based on the tabs you have open. Your currently active tab will take precedence. If your current tabs URL does not contain "/suite/" it will look at the active window from right to left until the URL matches "/suite/".

Also, new in version 0.2, if no tabs match "/suite/" it will use the default URL - set by clicking on the QOL Improvements extension icon in the extensions bar. 

We hope this incredible advancement greatly improves your quality of life.
